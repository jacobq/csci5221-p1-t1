CSci 5221: Project 1: Proposal
Data Aggregation & Analysis System for Intelligent Agriculture

Project Goal: For the purpose of this project our team intends to develop an Android application, capable of delivering heat-map videos of humidity and temperature (if time allows) time series for user defined locations and time periods. 

Project Motivation: The scenario that this project aims to replicate spans the area of Precision Agriculture and in particular delivering information, which is harvested in the field, to a mobile device based on user defined queries. In that way, utilizing low-cost sensor measurements, farmers can monitor the humidity (of the soil) and plan accordingly for their irrigation strategies.

Outline of the implementation (modules): The proposed methodology has three discrete components. The first, is concerned with the sensors’ deployment as well as the collection of measurements in the field. For the purposes of this study data will be simulated using appropriately selected random number generators since the timeframe does not allow experimentation with those hardware components as well. The second component includes multiple modules and refers to tasks that the server needs to perform. Three modules are associated with the server’s component; appropriate data indexing and storage, data analysis and a data visualization/video creation tool. The last component of this implementation refers to the client (Android device) which is responsible for submitting the user’s queries about the time frame as well as locations of interest. 

Summary: For this task our team will be utilizing a personal computer as the server of this system. In addition, the indexing and querying for stored information will be managed by (mention the database we will be using) while our team already has an Android device available. The data analytics module will be implemented in Python and will be responsible for deriving estimated measurements for a geographical area based on point measurements. The output of this script will be a *.jpg or *.png file corresponding to the humidity heat map for a given time frame and sensors corresponding to a selected section of the field. The set of images corresponding to the queried time frames will be then compiled in a video file and transmitted to the client.
